# Research Pipeline - Project Data Organization

**Date:** 2026-02-17
**Purpose:** Organize Antfarm pipeline data for OpenClaw UI research

---

## Data Organization Strategy

### Structure

```
SISO-RESEARCH-BASE/
├── projects/                    # INPUT: Raw project repos
│   └── openclaw-ui-projects/   # Your 14 OpenClaw command centers
│
├── objectives/                  # OUTPUT: Per-task analysis
│   └── openclaw-ui-research/   # ← ANT FARM OUTPUT HERE
│       ├── analysis.md
│       ├── findings.md
│       └── metadata.json
│
├── knowledge/                   # EXTRACTED: Reusable insights
│   ├── tools/
│   ├── patterns/
│   └── integrations/
│
└── memory/                      # OUTPUT: Daily summaries
    └── today.md
```

### Tagging Strategy

Add metadata to each objective:

```yaml
# objectives/openclaw-ui-research/metadata.json
{
  "task": "Analyze OpenClaw UI projects",
  "source": "antfarm-pipeline",
  "tags": ["openclaw-ui", "command-center", "antfarm"],
  "date": "2026-02-17",
  "status": "complete"
}
```

## Where Antfarm Output Goes

| Phase | Output Location | Tag |
|-------|----------------|-----|
| Raw analysis | `objectives/<task-name>/` | source: antfarm |
| Extracted tools | `knowledge/tools/` | +tag: antfarm |
| Extracted patterns | `knowledge/patterns/` | +tag: antfarm |
| Daily summary | `memory/today.md` | - |

---

## Recommendation

Put Antfarm output in `objectives/openclaw-ui-research/` with tags in metadata.json.

This keeps it separate but searchable.
