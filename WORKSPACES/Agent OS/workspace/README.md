# Agent OS Workspace

**Purpose:** Building the Agent OS — an operating system designed specifically for autonomous agents

## Description

This workspace is focused on creating an OS foundation for autonomous agents. The team researches OS patterns, builds implementations, and manages power systems for agents.

## Team

| Agent | Role | Focus |
|-------|------|-------|
| **power-gen** | Power Generation | Agent power needs, energy efficiency |
| **os-builder** | OS Builder | Implementing the OS |
| **os-researcher** | OS Researcher | Patterns, research, architecture |

## Architecture Goals

1. **Isolation** — Agents don't affect each other
2. **Scalability** — Support thousands of agents
3. **Autonomy** — Self-healing, self-managing
4. **Communication** — Inter-agent OS support
5. **Resource Management** — CPU, memory, I/O scheduling

## Key Research Areas

- Linux OS patterns (cgroups, namespaces, systemd)
- Container OS patterns (Alpine, Distroless)
- Agent-specific OS requirements
- Resource isolation and quotas

## Shared Knowledge

- Linux kernel concepts
- Containerization patterns
- OS architecture decisions
