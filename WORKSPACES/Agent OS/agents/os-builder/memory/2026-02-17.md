## Task Setter Agent Created
- Created new agent `task-setter` at `/Volumes/SISO-STORAGE-VAULT/SISO-VAULT/COMMAND-CENTER/WORKSPACES/Agent OS/agents/task-setter/`
- Agent helps turn ideas into actionable TASKS.md entries
- Clarifies scope, drafts tasks, suggests priority/workflow, adds to queue, can trigger Antfarm
- Files: AGENTS.md, SOUL.md, IDENTITY.md, USER.md, TOOLS.md, README.md

## TASK-004: CISO Command Center Rebrand
- Created task for rebrand: OpenClaw Studio → CISO Command Center
- Theme change: blue-tinted dark → Notion-style gray tones (#1a1a1a, #242424, #2f2f2f)
- Orange accents (#f97316) as complementary color
- Antfarm started with feature-dev workflow (Run #1)
- Workflow uses Kimi 2.5 model (kimi-coding/k2p5)

## Bug Fix: ProjectsSidebar.tsx
- Error: `Identifier 'selectedProjectId' has already been declared`
- Problem: prop `selectedProjectId` and `useState` with same name
- Fix in progress: replaced with `expandedProjects` useState for project expansion

## Antfarm Configuration
- Updated all 3 workflows to use Kimi 2.5:
  - feature-dev (6 agents)
  - bug-fix (6 agents)
  - security-audit (7 agents)
- Total 21 agents now use kimi-coding/k2p5
